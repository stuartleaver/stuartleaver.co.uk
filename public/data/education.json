        "date": "2012 – 2014",
        "company": "The Open University",
        "description": "The Software Development Programme developed a broad and critical understanding of all the processes for engineering high-quality software and the principles, concepts and techniques associated with software development. An ability to analyse and evaluate problems and draw on the theoretical and technical knowledge to develop solutions and systems. A range of skills focused on the analysis of requirements, design and implementation of reliable and maintainable software, with strong emphasis on engineering principles applied over the whole development lifecycle. A range of optional modules allows you to further your knowledge in closely related and more specialised areas such as project management, distributed systems and architectures of operating systems."

        "description": "The course covered a broad base of core modules with the opportunity to select some modules in the second year. This provided the fundamental knowledge to become rapidly established in the chosen field. Part of the course also involved undertaking a practical project. A lot of experience in using industry standard equipment and simulation packages was gained. The electronics work started with learning to design, construct and test many standard digital and analogue circuits. Coverage then progressed to the design of multistage and programmable circuits for use in larger system applications where computer and microprocessor interfacing becomes an important design element. The course also included Industrial Studies, which was an introduction to industrial and commercial practice, as well as development of report writing, communication, team working and project planning skills."

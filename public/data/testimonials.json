The project was always interesting and challenging and working with Stuart was a pleasure. He has a tremendous grasp of technology and the creative and technical ability to develop, automate, test and deploy the right solutions. On top of this, Stuart is very conscientious, good humoured and easy to get along with. I recommend him!",

At work he's an expert in C# and SQL combined with a thorough knowledge of the full Microsoft tech stack including Azure. He's also the kind of person who is always tinkering with Raspberry PIs, Python, Java and new tech in his own time - continuously learning. I've seen him mentor junior programmers through code reviews and teamwork. He earns respect from the whole team through his knowledge, his dedication to finding and resolving the root cause of issues and his determination. On a personal level I've always enjoyed working with him because (a) you can always trust his work and (b) he's funny, with a dry sense of humour.",
